# Beginner's guides to Fusion 360

This small web site was created for very beginners (especially pupils) who have never worked with [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview). Content of the site was made by students of [Moscow Polytechnic University](https://mospolytech.ru).

Every guide may have different quality and usefulness depending on who exactly made the one.

## Basic stuff

The site is made with Angular. In order to work with the site you will need to install few things first.

Run `npm i typescript -g` to install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) on your computer.

Run `npm i @angular/cli -g` to install [Angular](https://angular.io) on your computer.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
