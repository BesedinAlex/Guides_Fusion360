# Beginner's guides to Fusion 360

This small web site was made by students of [Moscow Polytechnic University](https://mospolytech.ru) for very beginners (especially pupils) who have never worked with [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

Content of every guide may have different quality and usefulness depending on who exactly made the one.

The site is made using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [three.js](https://threejs.org).

You need to compile TypeScript with `tsc` before loading to server.
