# Beginner's guides to Fusion 360

This small web site was made by students of [Moscow Polytechnic University](https://mospolytech.ru) for very beginners (especially pupils) who have never worked with [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

Content of every guide may have different quality and usefulness depending on who exactly made the one.
